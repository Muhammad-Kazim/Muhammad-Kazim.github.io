small changesI am an Artificial Intelligence enthusasit/practitioner/researcher. Curently, I work as remote AI consultant for Endress+Hauser, Germany. The general theme of my projects include identifying, mofifying and creating SOTA algorithms using computer vision and deep learning to automate industrial processes. One major domain is automation in quality control to preclude human intervention. These projects generally include heavy data augmentations, model selection, training/validation/testing, hyperparameter optimizations, streamlit demos, git version controlling, and docker containerization.

Background
==========

I completed my Master in Electronic Engineering from Kyung Hee University, South Korea in Feb, 2022. My thesis entitled, "Adaptive learning of Quantum DIgits" included the application of particle filtering with novel truncated Gaussian resampler, the diagonalization of density matrices, and an adaptive measurement procedure which improved the rate of estimation of quantum systems under certain assumptions. I also received a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan in Aug, 2018.s
