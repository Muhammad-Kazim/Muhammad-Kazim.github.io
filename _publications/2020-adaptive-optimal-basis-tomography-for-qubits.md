Abstract -- We present a two-level adaptive quantum state tomography protocol. On the first level, we utilize the particle distribution at each iteration to optimize the measurement setting of the next. On the second level, we use measurement outcomes to periodically reduce the set of measurement settings. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method by reporting infidelity and its standard deviation.
